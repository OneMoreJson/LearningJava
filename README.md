The “public static void” is a return type.  The word “void” can be changed to a double data type.  Need to understand functions verses operations.  Google GeeksforGeeks.org.  After chapter 5 challenge, we learn about classes.  Classes are user defined blueprint that has a set of attributes and behaviors that define the item that it is supposed to represent.  So, remember attributes, operations, and relations. Focusing on the attributes right now.  The Operations is known as a “behavior.”  It is also known as a function within Python and Java.  This is also called a “method.”  Interestingly, you can add the keyword “static” if the function does not use the attributes of a class, but still relates to the overall theme or idea of the class. More on this later…

An instance is an object created from a class blueprint.  So, ACCarrier c  lass can have USS Lincoln as an instance of that blueprint.  Creating an instance is done through a constructor.  A constructor is a special method or behavior inside every class that creates an initializes instances.  It is the construction yard to our Air Craft Carrier class.

### 2021 06 06 : 0830 || LL 01 IDE
Learning about the IDE (InteliJ).  Noticing that it runs slow on my current MacBook 13 inch (2013).  Java has two different data types: Primitive (Boolean, int, double, char) and Reference Types.  Also review strings, concatenation, and input/outputs.  Next we look at logic decisions.  Things like “Control Flow.” To test this, we did a Fortune Teller Flow Control program.  

Relational Operators: >, <, ==, , >=, <=, !=

#### 1400 || LL 01 Java
Completed debugging and Functions.  Found out that you can change an input into a double by using the .nextDoube() notation.  That changed my Scanner result into a double to be used for math.  Not bad!

## LL 01 Learning Java

### 2021 06 05 : 2200 || LL 01
Starting a 20 Hour Course on becoming a “Becoming a Java Programmer.”  The first course starts with “Learning Java” by  Kathryn Hodg.  This is a two hour and forty minute course.  It will take time to build off of this because it has been a long time since I have had a chance to actually study programming.
