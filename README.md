# Learning Java


### 2021 06 06 : 0830 || LL 01 IDE
Learning about the IDE (InteliJ).  Noticing that it runs slow on my current MacBook 13 inch (2013).  Java has two different data types: Primitive (Boolean, int, double, char) and Reference Types.  Also review strings, concatenation, and input/outputs.  Next we look at logic decisions.  Things like “Control Flow.” To test this, we did a Fortune Teller Flow Control program.  

Relational Operators: >, <, ==, , >=, <=, !=

Completed debugging and Functions.  Found out that you can change an input into a double by using the .nextDoube() notation.  That changed my Scanner result into a double to be used for math.  Not bad!

## LL 01 Learning Java

### 2021 06 05 : 2200 || LL 01
Starting a 20 Hour Course on becoming a “Becoming a Java Programmer.”  The first course starts with “Learning Java” by  Kathryn Hodg.  This is a two hour and forty minute course.  It will take time to build off of this because it has been a long time since I have had a chance to actually study programming.
