# Learning Java

### 2021 09 02 0400 || US07

Knocking out some challenges from the Udemy Course.  US07 stands of Udemy Section 07.  This challenge isn’t especially challenging.  However, it does reinforce how to check for an empty string: nameOfObject.isEmpty() … provides a boolean response which is used within the if statements.  This is the first time I’ve used it.

## Udemy Section 07

### 2021 08 31 1430 || Beginning

Starting Section 7:  OOP - Composition Encapsulation, and Polymorphism.

## Admin

I have been working on a Udemy Course Called: Java Programming Masterclass covering Java 11 & Java 17 by Tim Buchalka.  A ton of people have gone through his course and He does seem to try and keep it refreshed.  It does have some serious issues.  However, it seems to be the “most recommended” course online.  I really cannot find any other for the price of twenty dollars (on a Udemy sale).  I have completed Sections one through five.  That includes the tedious Code Challenges.  I also worked through section six, but I needed to skip the challenges because I’m trying to get the academic understanding to help with my college courses.  I find the coding challenges often hold you back from learning what you need to understand to grasp the bigger picture.  You will spend a ton of time trying to complete a challenge, only to know that you will never use it when you could just use something else Java provides.  It’s like being told to paint a wall with a toothbrush, when you know there’s a spray gun just a few lessons away!  Why slow the learning progress?  Actually, I really understand these challenges will help solidify educational point.  That is why I earmarked all the challenges to be done when I have limited internet capabilities… and time.  I need more time…

## Coursework

## Admin

### 2021 08 31 1300 || Clean

Clean up folders and deleted items not needed in GH.  I might want to clean folders and leave a report on what each course taught and if I think it was worth taking it.  I can’t have 1000s of MB files all showing “hello world” just because each class explains how to write the program using a different stack.

## LL 04 Java Memory Management

### 2021 08 28 1200 || LL 04 Return

Returning to the Linkedin Learning course on Java Memory Management.  I have been working on a Udemy course while completing my OOP Java course in AMU.  Now, its time to complete this LL course after learning what I’ve learned in the previous courses.  Later today, I will include the files completed in the Udemy course.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2021 08 30 || OOP Java Course

Completed Several College Courses. Although I am still learning, it might be time to post some that work. The instructors provide good feedback. However, I think I will learn even more when those within the community review and communicate their own experience in these projects. With that... and with some trepidation (^^), here we go...

How to debug and complete exception handling.  Create Custom Classes. Work with inheritance (Polymorphism).  Manage Data Collections. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2021 06 26 0900 || LL 02 

Worked through string, numbers and combining everything.  Here are the chapters: Manage String Values & Manage Program Flow.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2021 06 13 1600 || LL 02 Intro and Prep 

Set up files and journal.  Also, jshell is a very powerful tool.  Remember the following commands as they might help:

jshell (in the terminal)
/list
/save filename.java
/open filename.java
/reset
/help
/exit

Note: you always want to compile from the source directory (src) when you are working in the terminal.  This is done by “javac com/company/main.java” in the terminal.  Also “sout" is a shortcut for “System.out.println(“”);”  This is extremely useful!!!!

#### 1700 || strings and data
So much more!!!

## LL 02 Java 11+ Essential Training

### 2021 06 10 0800 || LL 02 Intro

First there is a package.  Then there is the class (public class Main).  Then there is a main method.  The parentheses defined parameters.  In the curly braces you have the main code.  JSHell allows you to test java code inside the terminal.  Java is also case sensitive.  Java is not white space sensitive (unlike python).  The end of your code, you must end with semicolon.  There is more about syntax and memory management.  Something we don’t talk about in other languages so far.  

The following helps you manage your memory use.  
Runtime.maxMemory()
Runtime.totalMemor()

### 2021 06 09 : 2000 || LL O1 Class Instances

Went over creating instances from classes using a triangle class.  This is just a simple view of everthing.  A lot of things are different when compared to Python.  I really do think that Python is more simple.  However, I like how Java can be compiled into machine code.  That lets it be used on MANY more types of devices.  I am having a little difficulty following.  I do think the problem is on me.  The instructor is actually great at mixing the tone and pitch of delivery.  I just need to watch some more and run through a lot more examples.  

Here is a Summary:
Class help organize our code; they contain attributes (also referred to as properties) and behavior (also referred to as methods).  Every class contains a constructor that can create instances.  The Class is a blueprint while the constructor builds instances from the blueprint.  

Finished LL 01

### 2021 06 08 : 1840 || LL 01 Class

The constructor may or may not take inputs.  A constructor always returns an instance of the class it’s in (that is, a constructor in the Triangle class returns a triangle) … because the lesson is talking about a class that creates triangles… What I’m winding is: Is an “instance” the same as and “object?”  This instruction seems to use words that are not consistent with what they saying… that or they interchange words that have different and same meanings!  Ok, objects come from class.  Actually I’ve learned about classes and objects. However, Java really does some unique thing that works similar, yet very different.  For one… a class created is actually now considered as a data type.  That is very different from what I am familiar with.  Although I don’t think it is divergent… it is not something other languages revealed as a concept.  More learning and comparisons will need to be made.  

Lets talk about the triangle class that we are going to build from the instructions.  Atribute variables are called instance variables because they are each instance will have a variable for.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 2021 06 07 : 0800 || LL 01 Functions

The “public static void” is a return type.  The word “void” can be changed to a double data type.  Need to understand functions verses operations.  Google GeeksforGeeks.org.  After chapter 5 challenge, we learn about classes.  Classes are user defined blueprint that has a set of attributes and behaviors that define the item that it is supposed to represent.  So, remember attributes, operations, and relations. Focusing on the attributes right now.  The Operations is known as a “behavior.”  It is also known as a function within Python and Java.  This is also called a “method.”  Interestingly, you can add the keyword “static” if the function does not use the attributes of a class, but still relates to the overall theme or idea of the class. More on this later…

An instance is an object created from a class blueprint.  So, ACCarrier c  lass can have USS Lincoln as an instance of that blueprint.  Creating an instance is done through a constructor.  A constructor is a special method or behavior inside every class that creates an initializes instances.  It is the construction yard to our Air Craft Carrier class.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2021 06 06 : 0830 || LL 01 IDE

Learning about the IDE (InteliJ).  Noticing that it runs slow on my current MacBook 13 inch (2013).  Java has two different data types: Primitive (Boolean, int, double, char) and Reference Types.  Also review strings, concatenation, and input/outputs.  Next we look at logic decisions.  Things like “Control Flow.” To test this, we did a Fortune Teller Flow Control program.  

Relational Operators: >, <, ==, , >=, <=, !=

#### 1400 || LL 01 Java
Completed debugging and Functions.  Found out that you can change an input into a double by using the .nextDoube() notation.  That changed my Scanner result into a double to be used for math.  Not bad!

## LL 01 Learning Java

### 2021 06 05 : 2200 || LL 01
Starting a 20 Hour Course on becoming a “Becoming a Java Programmer.”  The first course starts with “Learning Java” by  Kathryn Hodg.  This is a two hour and forty minute course.  It will take time to build off of this because it has been a long time since I have had a chance to actually study programming.
